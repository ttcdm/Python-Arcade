# Python-Arcade
A collection of python projects and games  

I started working on this during late 2020 or early 2021 (I don't remember the exact date).
pp5.py is the main file where I store all of my game projects involving the python package "Arcade" and "PySimpleGui".
PySimpleGui is only used for opening a window to select the different projects to run.
Arcade is the main package that is use to create the games.
I've only created this repository aa of February 2023, so there are no markers or past files to adequately mark
my progress over the past few years, but commitments will be pushed whenever I start another project.
